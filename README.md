Cogno V2 is a collection of smart contracts for UTxO-based cognomens and on-chain threads. Each Cogno acts as an user profile. Each thread is an on-chain message. Together they are a fully decentralized, completly public, social media platform. Ran entirely on the Cardano blockchain.

## Building

Use the `complete_build.sh` script to build the contracts using the data from `config.json`.

## Headless Happy Path Interaction

Use the `scripts` folder to interact with the dapp in a headless fashion.

## Frontend Interaction

Use the `app` folder to interact with the dapp using a cip30 web wallet.
